# `vim.pot` is updated every time any of the *.c files are modified.  And as it
# contains line numbers for strings from *.c files, inserting a line into a
# single .c file may cause many lines in the `vim.pot` file to be updated.
#
# This generates a lot of "noise" in the diffs.  And especially considering that
# `vim.pot` is a generated file, looking at changes in this file is not useful.
#
# By marking it as binary we tell the git machinery that it should not be
# presented to the user in patches, use "git diff --text" to override
src/po/vim.pot -diff

# Although vim.pot has been marked as binary, you may want to check the textual differences
# using git --text but still want to ignore some noisy output like:
# - POT-Creation Date
# - comments pointing to the message source location in
#   *.c/*.h/*.vim/*.cpp/*.in/*.xs files followed by line numbers
# Note: location comments should be no longer part of vim.pot, since commit 2844765e903214490e1
# which add the --no-location argument for xgettext to no longer ouput such comments
#
# To ignore certain changes, setup a custom textconv filter using:
# git config diff.ignore_vim_pot.textconv "grep -Ev '^.(POT-Creation-Date:|.*\\.([ch]|vim|in|xs|cpp):).*$'"

# GitHub reacts to the `linguist-generated` attribute, by ignoring marked files
# for the repository's language statistics and hiddning changes in these files
# by default in diffs.
